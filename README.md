Senior Capstone Project - Spring 2021

Members: Hunter Blackwood, Rachel Coughanour, Greg McGlathery, Mitchell Patterson 

Description: This project involves creating a WordPress website that collects and displays community events for users to view and add entries to. We have the WordPress site hosted on a live server and will have forms that connect to a backend database to store and retrieve data.
